-- This function does three things:
--
-- * Creates the route datatype AppRoute. Every valid URL in your
--   application can be represented as a value of this type.
-- * Creates the associated type:
--       type instance Route App = AppRoute
-- * Creates the value resourcesApp which contains information on the
--   resources declared below. This is used in Handler.hs by the call to
--   mkYesodDispatch
--
-- What this function does *not* do is create a YesodSite instance for
-- App. Creating that instance requires all of the handler functions
-- for our application to be in scope. However, the handler functions
-- usually require access to the AppRoute datatype. Therefore, we
-- split these actions into two functions and place them in separate files.
