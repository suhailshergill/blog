    the comments aren't insightful enough to warrant the effort needed to maintain
    their local backups. additionally, with disqus-2012 it seems likely that google
    will eventually start indexing the comments since disqus-2012 uses iframes. see:

  - [X] css [2/2]
    - [X] [[https://github.com/chriseppstein/compass][compass]] or [[https://github.com/joshuaclayton/blueprint-css][blueprint]]?
      hmm compass is a meta framework. so more like compass *with* blueprint.
    - [X] ruby [[https://github.com/nkryptic/sandbox][sandboxing]]. [2/2]
      needed because compass is ruby based (uses sass)
      - [X] install [[https://github.com/nkryptic/sandbox][sandbox]]
      - [X] integrate it with virtualenv: using postactivate.sh
  - [X] workflow/capabilities [3/3]
    - [X] org-mode integration [1/1]
      - [X] format: markdown?. nope this wouldn't really make much
        sense. org-mode syntax is as expressive as i need to be. sure if i want
        to write blog posts from outside emacs this will be cool. but meh
    - [X] content based. i.e., changes get reflected to: [2/2]
      - [X] actual posts
        have the ability to update tags and content etc. using CUSTOM_ID
        property as the unique identifier
      - [X] views based on posts
    - [X] integration with google+ etc? not all that hopeful, but would be nice
      to see options there.
      - using [[http://ifttt.com][ifttt]]
  - [-] database connectivity [1/2]
    - [X] main content (exported from org)?
    - [-] comments [1/2]
      - [X] using [[http://disqus.com][disqus]] right now
      - [ ] probably want to make local backups using their [[http://docs.disqus.com/help/58/][api]].
  - [X] rss feed

    don't really see a strong need for using yesod from source especially when it's
    available via hackage. will be using a sandboxed installation via virthualenv
