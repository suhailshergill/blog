  - [X] css [2/2]
    - [X] [[https://github.com/chriseppstein/compass][compass]] or [[https://github.com/joshuaclayton/blueprint-css][blueprint]]?
      hmm compass is a meta framework. so more like compass *with* blueprint.
    - [X] ruby [[https://github.com/nkryptic/sandbox][sandboxing]]. [2/2]
      needed because compass is ruby based (uses sass)
      - [X] install [[https://github.com/nkryptic/sandbox][sandbox]]
      - [X] integrate it with virtualenv: using postactivate.sh
  - [-] workflow/capabilities [1/3]
    - [X] org-mode integration [1/1]
      - [X] format: markdown?. nope this wouldn't really make much
        sense. org-mode syntax is as expressive as i need to be. sure if i want
        to write blog posts from outside emacs this will be cool. but meh
    - [ ] content based. i.e., changes get reflected to: [0/2]
      - [ ] actual posts
      - [ ] views based on posts
    - [ ] integration with google+ etc? not all that hopeful, but would be nice
      to see options there.
  - [ ] database connectivity [0/2]
    - [ ] main content (exported from org)?
    - [ ] comments

    don't really see a strong need for using yesod from source especially when it's
    available via hackage. will be using a sandboxed installation via virthualenv
