* TODO resurrect blog [0/2]                                            :blog:

    i think i'm going to switch to hakyll coupled with some additional testing (ruby
    gem and haskell based) instead of using jekyll. see:
    - http://cliffle.com/article/2015/05/09/hakyll/
    - https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/3f0yld/dr_hakyll_create_a_github_page_with_hakyll_and/

    so the jekyll equivalent of wrappers/delimited continuations are called
    layouts. did a basic translation of [[git:~/virtualEnvs/blog/src/blog/templates/default-layout-wrapper.hamlet::dev@{2016-01-02}][default-layout-wrapper.hamlet]] into
    _layouts/default.html in gh-pages branch.

    need to figure emacs provisioning w/ customizations as the next step

    the DNS issues were resolved. so for each subdomain/github repo i would need to
    do two things:
    - add CNAME to gh-pages branch
    - add CNAME entry in linode pointing to suhailshergill.github.io
    
    the above works because nic.ru redirects DNS requests for *.shergill.su to
    linode nameservers. and within linode we then forward requests to
    suhailshergill.github.io as needed. note, that as per [[https://help.github.com/articles/tips-for-configuring-a-cname-record-with-your-dns-provider/][github help]] we
    shouldn't use wildcard DNS records w/ github pages since it will allow
    anyone to host a github pages site at one of my subdomains.

    trying to debug dns issues.
    for a moment blog.shergill.su worked. it doesn't any more. one of the things
    changed was the deletion of redirect of blog.shergill.su to
    suhailshergill.github.io.
    
    shergill.su works. for it i did:
      - [[https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-cname-file-to-your-repository/][added CNAME to github.com/suhailshergill/suhailshergill.github.io]]
      - [[https://help.github.com/articles/tips-for-configuring-an-a-record-with-your-dns-provider/][added AAAA record pointing to 192.30.252.153 and 192.30.252.154]]
    trying to see if docs.shergill.su works. tried:
      - added CNAME to github.com/suhailshergill/docs
      - added redirect to linode docs.shergill.su -> suhailshergill.github.io

     - [X] figure out CDN
       - use [[https://rawgit.com/][rawgit]] for CDN
         no, it's better to just use the gh-pages branch. use the travis script
         to compile the content and publish to gh-pages.

    this will automatically happen once i move to github pages
  something like [[https://gist.github.com/3889970][what gist does]] will be nice, but i don't want to simply be
  inserting gists via js. makes it harder for people to get at the content. of
  course the solution might be to use github pages ([[http://jdodds.github.com/][example]]), or invent
  something of your own along those lines. hmm [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/359424/detach-subdirectory-into-separate-git-repository][creating a separate git repo for
  blog posts]] (currently with all my assorted org files) would probably be the
  way to go.
   - run a git-commit and push on [[help:after-save-hook][after-save-hook]]
   - [[help:find-file-hook][find-file-hook]] see if there's something which fires earlier?

    well the [[https://github.com/johnsmclay/icnfnt][icnfnt]] site is down, but i am questioning the worth of this.
    that being said, note that there are alternatives like [[http://fontello.com/][fontello]] and [[https://icomoon.io/app/][icomoon]] as
    per [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15331525/optimize-font-awesome-for-only-used-classes][stackoverflow post]].

    the comments aren't insightful enough to warrant the effort needed to maintain
    their local backups. additionally, with disqus-2012 it seems likely that google
    will eventually start indexing the comments since disqus-2012 uses iframes. see:

  - [X] css [2/2]
    - [X] [[https://github.com/chriseppstein/compass][compass]] or [[https://github.com/joshuaclayton/blueprint-css][blueprint]]?
      hmm compass is a meta framework. so more like compass *with* blueprint.
    - [X] ruby [[https://github.com/nkryptic/sandbox][sandboxing]]. [2/2]
      needed because compass is ruby based (uses sass)
      - [X] install [[https://github.com/nkryptic/sandbox][sandbox]]
      - [X] integrate it with virtualenv: using postactivate.sh
  - [X] workflow/capabilities [3/3]
    - [X] org-mode integration [1/1]
      - [X] format: markdown?. nope this wouldn't really make much
        sense. org-mode syntax is as expressive as i need to be. sure if i want
        to write blog posts from outside emacs this will be cool. but meh
    - [X] content based. i.e., changes get reflected to: [2/2]
      - [X] actual posts
        have the ability to update tags and content etc. using CUSTOM_ID
        property as the unique identifier
      - [X] views based on posts
    - [X] integration with google+ etc? not all that hopeful, but would be nice
      to see options there.
      - using [[http://ifttt.com][ifttt]]
  - [-] database connectivity [1/2]
    - [X] main content (exported from org)?
    - [-] comments [1/2]
      - [X] using [[http://disqus.com][disqus]] right now
      - [ ] probably want to make local backups using their [[http://docs.disqus.com/help/58/][api]].
  - [X] rss feed

    don't really see a strong need for using yesod from source especially when it's
